API Changes
===========

Changed WebP default "method" value when saving
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Previously, it was 0, for the best speed. The default has now been changed to 4, to
match WebP's default, for higher quality with still some speed optimisation.

Default resampling filter for special image modes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Pillow 7.0 changed the default resampling filter to ``Image.BICUBIC``. However, as this
is not supported yet for images with a custom number of bits, the default filter for
those modes has been reverted to ``Image.NEAREST``.

ImageMorph incorrect mode errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For ``apply()``, ``match()`` and ``get_on_pixels()``, if the image mode is not L, an
:py:exc:`Exception` was thrown. This has now been changed to a :py:exc:`ValueError`.

API Additions
=============

ImageOps.contain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Returns a resized version of the image, set to the maximum width and height within
``size``, while maintaining the original aspect ratio.

To compare it to other ImageOps methods:

- :py:meth:`~PIL.ImageOps.fit` expands an image until is fills ``size``, cropping the
  parts of the image that do not fit.
- :py:meth:`~PIL.ImageOps.pad` expands an image to fill ``size``, without cropping, but
  instead filling the extra space with ``color``.
- :py:meth:`~PIL.ImageOps.contain` is similar to :py:meth:`~PIL.ImageOps.pad`, but it
  does not fill the extra space. Instead, the original aspect ratio is maintained. So
  unlike the other two methods, it is not guaranteed to return an image of ``size``.

ICO saving: bitmap_format argument
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, Pillow saves ICO files in the PNG format. They can now also be saved in BMP
format, through the new ``bitmap_format`` argument::

    im.save("out.ico", bitmap_format="bmp")

Other Changes
=============

Added DDS BC5 reading
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Support has been added to read the BC5 format of DDS images, whether UNORM, SNORM or
TYPELESS.
